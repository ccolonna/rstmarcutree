        =================================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library helps you to process a Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Tree
        
        It returns a RSTTree representing the tree composed by RSTNode.
        The tree is enriched with attribute like promotion set described by Daniel Marcu in paper:
        
        * Building up rhetorical structure tree 1996
        
        * Discourse trees are good indicators of importance in test 1999
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        RstMarcuTree has support for python 2.7
        
        dependencies: discoursegraphs
        
        $ pip2.7 install rstmarcutree
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The library process a file containing a rst tree in .dis format.
        You can use online discourse dependency parser like feng hirst 2014 parser to produce
        a discourse tree of a text.

        You can use:
            https://github.com/NLPbox/rst-converter-service
        to easily convert the file in .dis output:
        
        having ./test_rst.dis file path in python2.7 console or script you can just just:
        
        >>> from rstmarcutree import load_tree
        >>>
        >>> rst_tree = load_tree('./test_rst.dis')
        >>>
        >>> root = rst_tree.get(0)
        >>>
        >>> root_satellite = root.get_satellite()
